# lusp
lusp is a lisp created using Daniel Holden's
[*Build Your Own Lisp*](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) as
a starting point. However, it differs significantly from the
lisp built in the book.

## Installation
```bash
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./parsing
```

## diff against *Build Your Own Lisp*
* lusp supports floating point numbers.
* lusp supports power, min, max, and modulus operations.

* lusp probably has some other stuff I don't remember.
